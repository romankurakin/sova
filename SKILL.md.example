# PDF Search Skill (sova)

Search your indexed PDF documents using semantic search.
Assumes `sova` is already globally installed and available in `PATH`.

## When to Use

- Looking up information in reference documents
- Finding relevant sections across multiple PDFs
- Verifying facts or quotes from source materials

## Search

```bash
# Semantic search
sova -s "your search query"
sova -s "query" -n 5        # Fewer results
sova -s "query" -n 20       # More results

# Text search (exact matches)
rg -i "keyword" ~/.sova/data/*.md
```

Search returns `~/.../file.md:start-end` plus full chunk text. Use Read tool for extra surrounding context (add ~50 lines buffer):

```bash
# Search returns: ~/.../mybook.md:580-650
# Read with context buffer
```

```
Read ~/.sova/data/mybook.md lines 530-700
```

## Setup

If the database doesn't exist or is incomplete:

```bash
# Create symlink to PDFs (if not exists)
ln -s /path/to/docs ~/.sova/docs

# Check status
sova --list

# Index all PDFs (models auto-pull on first run)
sova
```

Requires Ollama running. Models are pulled automatically.

## Adding Documents

Drop PDFs in the symlinked directory and re-run indexing:

```bash
sova new-doc-name
```
